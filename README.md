# Capstone_1

## The Boardgame Shelf 


 "The Boardgame Shelf'' is a board game collection management app built for my first capstone project in Springboard's software engineering program. It allows a user
to store a digital representation of their board game collection, save games to a wishlist, value their games or collection as a whole and create playlogs for game playthroughs. 

 It is a web application built primarily with Python/Flask, it integrates a third party API that allows for searching through thousands of popular and even not so popular 
board games. Data is stored in a Postgresql database managed in Python using SQLAlchemy, sensitive information is encrypted with Bcrypt. The app is user friendly and very 
intuitive to use. Try the deployed version yourself at www.theboardgameshelf.net

 I would consider the project 'complete', that being said I do have a feature that allows users to subscribe to price alerts and set a target price for games in their wishlist, this feature is not currently implemented with an external API/automatic email alerts but it's something I plan on doing at some point in the future. Any suggestions or critiques are welcome.
 
Thank You!
